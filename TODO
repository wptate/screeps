auto-build creeps
auto-replace dying creeps(health or ttl)
	Determine ttl and make sure to drop off/finish task prior to death, then kick off new spawn
	Delete memory at death
	auto-name new units
	Need to check max count of roles and ensure we don't overload on certain types.
	Should also check to ensure we don't NOT build certain types at times
	correctly calculate cost of build
	Split spawning from main
	Start with smaller bodies, build up from there
Allow builders/etc to suppliment work when available, prioritize role but offer secondary roles
	allow role switching, roles available and current role for performing duties.  Switch when required or when idle
prioritize energy locations for harvesters
build storage, allow harvester to harvest/store, movers ship from storage to perm storage
Calculate balance of upgrade/build with harvesting.  When harvest below threshold, stop/don't spawn/etc
Merge roles into single file, reduce duplication
Link  IDE to source for reference
Add distance factor to priority
